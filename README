# CISC101 – Academic Paper Summarizer (Group 48)

This repository contains the prompt design and modular specification for an **Academic Paper Summarizer** system, built for the CISC101 PS3 “Student Activities” assignment.

The goal is to define a **system prompt** and a set of **internal modules** that an AI assistant can use to summarize academic papers in a structured, safe, and consistent way.


## Overview

The Academic Paper Summarizer:

- **Input:** An academic paper segmented into labeled sections  
  (e.g., Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, etc.).
- **Output:** A **unified summary** that synthesizes key points from all sections, plus additional helpful views (section-by-section, expert vs layperson, glossary, checks & warnings).
- **Constraints (from PS2):**
  1. Each section summary must **not exceed 150 words**.  
  2. Terminology must remain **consistent** across all section summaries and the unified summary.

This repo does **not** contain executable code. Instead, it defines prompts and module specs that can be used to configure an AI assistant.
